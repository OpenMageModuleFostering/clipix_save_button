<br>
When they are ready to purchase, instead of searching for items again they will now easily get back to your website, with one click of a button, to the exact product page to execute their purchase.  Additionally, visitors can set a price drop alert for items that they save, which will automatically alert them when your merchandise goes on sale.",
